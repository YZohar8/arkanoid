## Prerequisites 🛠️
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher** ☕
- **Apache Maven** (optional, if your project uses Maven for dependency management or building) 📦
- **Git** (for cloning the repository) 🧑‍💻

## How to Run 🚀

### 1. Clone the Repository 🧑‍💻
Clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YZohar8/arkanoid.git
cd arkanoid

### 2. Install Java Development Kit ☕
If you don’t have JDK installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install default-jdk

### 3. Compile the Project ⚙️
Compile the source files into .class files:

```bash
javac -cp biuoop-1.4.jar -d out src/**/*.java
- This command will compile all Java files from the src directory and place the generated .class files into the out directory.

### 4. Run the Application 🏃‍♂️
To start the game, run the following command:

```bash
java -cp out/production/ass6:biuoop-1.4.jar Ass6Game <level1> <level2> <level3> ....
Where level1, level2, and level3 represent the sequence of levels you wish to play. For example:

```bash
java -cp out/production/ass6:biuoop-1.4.jar Ass6Game 1 2 3

### 5. Pause the Game ⏸️
During gameplay, you can pause the game by pressing the p key. This will stop the game temporarily, and you can resume by pressing p again. ⏯️
