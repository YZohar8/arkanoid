# Arkanoid Game 🎮

## Introduction 📝
A Java-based implementation of the classic Arkanoid game, demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts including game physics, animations, and user interactions. The game requires Java 11 or higher to run.

## Game Features 🎯
The game includes several key features that enhance the gaming experience:

- Multiple difficulty levels with unique layouts and challenges
- Real-time physics engine for smooth ball movement and collisions
- Interactive paddle control system
- Pause functionality using the `P` key
- Score tracking and level progression
- Engaging animations and visual effects

## Prerequisites 🛠️
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Apache Maven (optional, for dependency management)
- Git (for version control and cloning the repository)

## Installation and Setup 🚀

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YZohar8/arkanoid.git
cd arkanoid
```

### 2. Install Java Development Kit
For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
```bash
sudo apt install default-jdk
```
For other operating systems, download the appropriate JDK from the official Oracle website.

### 3. Compile the Project
Compile all source files into the output directory:
```bash
javac -cp biuoop-1.4.jar -d out src/**/*.java
```

### 4. Run the Game
Launch the game with your desired level sequence:
```bash
java -cp out/production/ass6:biuoop-1.4.jar Ass6Game <level1> <level2> <level3>
```

Example command to play levels 1, 2, and 3 in sequence:
```bash
java -cp out/production/ass6:biuoop-1.4.jar Ass6Game 1 2 3
```

## Gameplay Instructions 🎮

### Controls
- **Left Arrow**: Move paddle left
- **Right Arrow**: Move paddle right
- **P**: Pause/Resume game
- **Space**: Launch ball (at game start)

### Level System
The game features three distinct difficulty levels:

1. **Level 1 - Beginner** 🟢
   - Simple block layouts
   - Slower ball speed
   - Perfect for learning the game mechanics

2. **Level 2 - Intermediate** 🟡
   - More complex block patterns
   - Increased ball speed
   - Additional obstacles

3. **Level 3 - Advanced** 🔴
   - Challenging block arrangements
   - Maximum ball speed
   - Strategic block placement
